</a>Today, villagers of Kantipur, Indrabasti and South Ayodhyapuri located in Ayodhyapuri VDC of Madi, Chitwan organized a ceremony to mark the inauguration of Shree Baikunthe Gadhimai Bhagawati Underground Drinking Water Supply Project. The two Solar PV pumping systems (one in Kantipur and another in Indrabasti) implemented under the project are designed, installed and commissioned by Suryodaya Urja Pvt. Ltd. in turnkey basis. Each system pumps over 23,000 liters of water from underground boreholes to the overhead tanks built on 20m high towers.The vertical head of both the systems is around 50 meters. The 30,000 liter tanks on the two towers store enough water to supply to over 275 families residing in the three villages. The clean drinking water from the tanks are distributed through 42 tap posts.</p>
